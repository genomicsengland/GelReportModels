/**
The DataIntakeProtocol defines two records for injecting report events into CVA:

   - InterpretedGenomeInject
   - ClinicalReportInject

The above entities contain either an InterpretedGenome or a ClinicalReport that have list of variants,
having themselves lists of report events. The variants will go through the variant ingestion pipeline,
normalised, checked against the reference genome for validity and lifted over.

The DataIntakeProtocol defined two records to inject exit questionnaires into CVA:

    - ExitQuestionnaireInjectRD
    - ExitQuestionnaireInjectCancer

The exit questionnaires are transformed into a report event for storage in CVA. Variants are also
processed through the variant ingestion pipeline as described above.

The DataIntakeProtocol defines two records for injecting sample information into CVA:

    - PedigreeInject
    - CancerParticipantInject

Pedigree and cancer participant data are stored in ad hoc collections and the most relevant bits of
information (e.g.: proband present HPO terms) are used to annotate the cases.

When any of these entities is pushed to CVA, a Transaction will be created and processing will happen
asynchronously. Successful push does not imply successful processing.
