DataIntakeRDProtocol defines three records for injecting variant data

   - TieredVariantInjectRD
   - ReportedVariantInjectRD
   - CandidateVariantInjectRD

Every ReportedVariant is uniquely identified by:

   - report event id
   - report model version
   - id
   - version
   - family id
   - cohort id
   - variants identifiers (being a variant identifier formed by chromosome + position + reference + alternate)

Any duplication of a ReportedVariant will be rejected.
